# Introduction Note

ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to NotePlan! ðŸŽ‰

NotePlan supports and extends Markdown. Make use of it to create Todos and events in your calendar. Use it also to make your note easier to read.

On macOS hover the left side of a note or use the menubar to mark your Todos. On iOS you will see a toolbar above the keyboard with the same tools.

## Todos (thatâ€™s a title)
* Todos start with '* ' or '- '.
* They can be marked as

    * [x] Done (orange in calendar)
    * [>] Scheduled (blue in calendar, will be copied for you)
    * [-] Cancelled (not shown in your calendar)

* Press `Tab/Backtab` to shift Todos as I have done above. On iOS hit the indent button in the keyboard toolbar.
* Start titles with '# ' to separate Todos for different Projects for example.

If you `schedule` a Todo through the menu on the left with the ðŸ•˜ icon, it will be automatically copied for you (you can also select multiple Todos along with a title).

## More Markdown
The minimum you should know about Markdown is described above. But here are a few more things you should know:

You can make text **bold** or *italic*. Or mark them like `this` (inline code). If you add a time like @12:00 in the macOS version. It will be shown on the calendar.

On macOS look for the `?` left of each note (hover the left area) to get an overview.

**Lists**:
1. One
2. Two
3) Three
4) Four
* Five
* Six

## Linking
You can link between notes, both normal and calendar notes. Normal notes are linked with the [[Title]] and calendar notes with [[YYYY-MM-DD]], like [[2017-10-10]]. If the note does not exist, it will be created.

## Tagging
You can tag normal notes (not calendar notes) by writing #welcome for example anywhere in the note. Most convenient is to write it at the bottom. A tag filter will be created in the notes overview. You can also click or tap on the tag to activate the filter.

## Help
Write to `hello@noteplan.co` for help, ok ðŸ‘Œ?

Thanks for your time!
