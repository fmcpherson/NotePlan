First thoughts about NotePlan
Like the clean, minimalist display. 
Like that I can link to calendar notes like: @2018-05-05 but wish it was easier to come back. Still trying to figure it out. 
To move a task item need to hide the keyboard 
I wish that NotePlan worked like a wiki for linking rather than just markdown. Often the keyboard activates and therefore the links donâ€™t work. 
Not an Outliner, so when you move a parent of an indented item the child does not move 
Enabled appending links to scheduled tasks.
